    <description>
**choco-persistent-packages** (re)installs any missing crucial Chocolatey packages that you designate as persistant packages. Uninstall a persistent package and it will be installed again ready for use the next day. 

This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "cinst $env:ChocolateyInstall\config\persistentpackages.config -y" every day at a time that you specify.

Be sure to look at the companion package [choco-persistent-packages-abort](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages-abort).

###WHO IS THIS FOR?
 **choco-persistent-packages** is designed for [Chocolatey Pro](https://chocolatey.org/pricing) and [Chocolatey Business](https://chocolatey.org/pricing) licensed users who's computers are not necessarily under [Active Directory Directory Services Group Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh147307(v=ws.10).aspx) control or other system mananagement utilities that can enforce software installation and desired state.

###WHY DO I NEED THIS?
If you have users/employees/a friend/a little brother/etc. that uninstalls programs/Chocolatey packages that you don't want uninstalled, **choco-persistent-packages** will (re)install those programs/Chocolatey packages that you deem necessary to keep installed. Basically you create a list of important packages and **choco-persistent-packages** will reinstall them every day if they are missing.

###WHY DO I NEED TO BE A CHOCOLATEY PRO OR BUSINESS USER?

You don't. But **choco-persistent-packages** will only work if the Chocolatey package data is missing. If a program is uninstalled outside of Chocolatey via Programs and Features this will not have any effect as Chocolatey and **choco-persistent-packages** will not know the program has been uninstalled.  Chocolatey Pro and Business editions include a feature called [Package Synchronizer - Automatic Sync](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-synchronize) which removes the Chocolatey package data when a program is uninstalled via Programs and Features. After this synchronization occurs (every execution of choco.exe), **choco-persistent-packages** will see the program/package missing and reinstall it at the designated time.
	

###INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
You can set the time by running **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/Time:XX:XX'"**. When entering the TIME parameter, use "[Military Time](http://militarytimechart.com/)." Not entering the correct format will fail the install. Please see the examples below.

###INSTALL EXAMPLES:
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/Time:04:00'"** - (re)installs persistent packages 4 AM
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/Time:06:30'"** - (re)installs persistent packages 6:30 AM
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/Time:21:00'"** - (re)installs persistent packages at 9 PM
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/Time:23:30'"** - (re)installs persistent packages 11:30 PM

If you don't specify a time, it defaults to midnight.

###POST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
* Edit \ProgramData\Chocolatey\config\persistentpackages.config and read the comments section.

If you have a previous release of **choco-persistent-packages** installed, upgrading to a new version will NOT modify your current scheduled task or list of persistent packages.
