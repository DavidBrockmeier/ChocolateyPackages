**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* DISCLAIMER: This package uses an AutoHotKey script to attempt automatic installation of the program. I have done my best to make this work for the majority, there are always a number of x-factors that can cause a 'hiccup.' Some events are timed and may timeout and thus fail on slower than expected systems. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you monitor the installation of this package to make sure it worked/installed correctly in your environment. There are situations such as upgrades and forced reinstalls that may not work and you will have to manually enter input to get the desired result. If you report an issue in GitHub and the program is in active development, I will try to enhance the AHK script and this package in the future.
* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
* This package checks for already installed Intel adapter drivers before installing and will throw an exception if none are found. Howerver it does not verify you have supported Intel drivers, just an already installed Intel network adapter. Thus it also fails Chocolatey's automated testing.
* Intel® Network Adapter Driver for Windows® 10 (Install) 22.3 never worked. Apologies to the 68 people who downloaded it and THOUGHT it installed, it didn't.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
