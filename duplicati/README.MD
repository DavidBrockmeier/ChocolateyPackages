**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* v2.x is still considered pre-release/"experimental" (beta) and in active development.
* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* I experimented with this program, liked it, but decided to use [Arq](https://chocolatey.org/packages/arq) for my backups. I will update the package on request and check for new releases infrequently. If anyone wants to help co-maintain this package, just ask and I'd be happy for the help.
