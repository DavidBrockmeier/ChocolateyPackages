**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
