**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* If you don't like the default scheduled time to run, you can easily change it using Window's TaskScheduler.
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

CHANGELOG:
* 0.0.3 - Rewritten version of 0.0.1 with XML configuration file and ferventcoder/Rob's approved default settings.
* 0.0.2 - Unreleased version with two scripts with different default settings; "Bill's way" and "Rob's way" and a package parameter to choose which one to use/install. Shelved.
* 0.0.1 - Initial release. Did not pass Chocolatey moderation due to mandated changes of default parameters. Only "secretly" available.
