#MODERATORS DO NOT PASS! - IN FINAL TESTING PHASE

	
##DO YOU WANT TO RECOVER SOME DISK SPACE USED BY UNNECESSARY CHOCOLATEY FILES? 

##YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!

###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run choco-cleaner.ps1 every day at 11:30 PM


(11:30 PM was chosen as not to conflict with **[choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** when installed with the default set to run at midnight.)

**BEFORE and AFTER choco-cleaner (198 packages installed and does not include temp folders)**
![schreenshot of files and diskspace  before choco-cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-cleaner/choco-cleaner_before.png) ![schreenshot of files and diskspace after choco-cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-cleaner/choco-cleaner_after.png)

	
##**choco-cleaner deletes:**
* .log files that are not the most current one
* .msi and .zip files left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
* .msi.ignore files created to ignore the .msi file for shimming - not needed as we are deleting the .msi files
* .zip.txt and .exe.txt files are lists of files that were extracted from an archive file for installation
* credits.txt are credits files you can read on the web
* readme.txt files you can read on the web
* .md files are usually markdown readme files that you can read on the web
* .old files are Chocolatey files that have been replaced by newer ones (exe's and dll's mostly)
* chocolatey.config.backup is a backup of your chocolatey.config file
* _processed.txt - I have no idea what made this file
* lib-bad holds packages that failed to install and lib-bkp contains aborted packages (during updates?) 
* \Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\chocolatey is where new package files are downloaded to
* \Users\username\AppData\Local\Chocolatey similar to above
* license.txt and verification.txt files are included when packages include binaries, you can read them on the package web page
* programname.license.txt files are license information for Chocolatey default tools

You can edit \ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\choco-cleaner\tools\choco-cleaner.ps1 and comment out anything you do not want to delete.

**Organizations with software license compliance auditing should comment out and NOT delete the license and verification files for legal protection.**

You can manually run choco-cleaner at any time by running \ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\choco-cleaner\tools\manuallyrunchoco-cleaner.bat

**Sure, you're not going to get gigabytes of space back, but every few KB matters on some computers and to some people! Due to [slack space](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/slack-space.htm) small files such as a 6 byte .ignore file actually takes up 4 KB of HDD space.**

If you have a previous release of **choco-cleaner** installed, upgrading to a new version will NOT modify your current scheduled task or time.
