#THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (almost done) - MODERATORS DO NOT PASS!	
	
##DO YOU WANT TO RECOVER SOME DISK SPACE USED BY UNNECESSARY CHOCOLATEY FILES? 

##YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!
	
###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run choco-cleaner.ps1 every day at midnight


**choco-cleaner deletes:**
* log files that are not the most current one
* msi and zip files that are left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
* msi.ignore files created to ignore the file for shimming, but we just deleted the msi files
* zip.txt and exe.txt files are list of files that were extracted from an archive file
* license.txt and *.license.txt are license files that you can read on the web
* credits.txt are credits files you can read on the web
* license.txt and verification.txt files are included when packges have binaries, you can read them on the web
* programname.license.txt files are license information for Chocolatey tools
* readme.txt files you can read on the web
* md files are usually markdown read me's that you can read on the web
* old files are Chocolatey files that have been replaced by newer ones (exe's and dll's mostly)
* _processed.txt - I have no idea what made this file
* backup files are 

Sure. You're not going to get gigabytes of space back, but every few KB matters to some people!

If you have a previous release of **choco-cleaner** installed, upgrading to a new version will NOT modify your current scheduled task or time.
