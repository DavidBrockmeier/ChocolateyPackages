    <description>
##DO YOU WANT TO RECOVER SOME DISK SPACE USED BY UNNECESSARY RESIDUAL CHOCOLATEY FILES? 

##YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!

####This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run choco-cleaner.ps1 every day at 11:30 PM.

(11:30 PM was chosen as not to conflict with **[choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** when installed with the default set to run at midnight.)

**BEFORE and AFTER choco-cleaner: (198 packages installed and does not include temp folder deletions.)**
![schreenshot of files and diskspace  before choco-cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-cleaner/choco-cleaner_before.png) ![schreenshot of files and diskspace after choco-cleaner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/choco-cleaner/choco-cleaner_after.png)

	
##**choco-cleaner deletes:**
* .log files that are not the most current one
* .zip, .rar, .iso, and various archive files left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
* .zip.txt and other archive-extensions.txt are lists of files that were extracted from an archive file for installation
* .msi, .msu, and .msp are Microsoft intall packages left over from packages that forgot to delete them post install
* .ignore files are created to not shim executables during package install but not needed after shim operations are finished (This may change in a future version of Chocolatey.)
* credits.txt are program credits (of contributors) files you can read on the web
* readme.txt files you can read on the web
* .md files are usually markdown readme files that you can read on the web
* .old files are Chocolatey files that have been replaced by newer versions (exe's and dll's mostly)
* chocolatey.config.backup is a backup of your chocolatey.config file
* _processed.txt - I have no idea what made this file
* lib-bad holds packages that failed to install and lib-bkp contains aborted packages (during updates?) 
* archives and executables out of .nuspkg files which are ZIP archives with NuGet package information - this is similar to what [Package Reducer](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-package-reducer) does
* \Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\chocolatey is where new package files are downloaded to during pre-installation (if you haven't changed your cacheLocation in chocolatey.config))
* license.txt and verification.txt files are included when packages include binaries, you can read them on the package web page, programname.license.txt files are license files for Chocolatey default tools

You can edit \ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\choco-cleaner\tools\choco-cleaner.ps1 and comment out anything you do not want to delete.

**Organizations with software license compliance auditing should comment out and NOT delete the license and verification files for legal protection. It's also recommended that you pin this package so any future updates don't overwrite your modifications to the default script.**

You can manually run choco-cleaner at any time by running \ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\choco-cleaner\tools\choco-cleaner-manual.bat

**Sure, you're not going to get gigabytes of space back, but every few KB matters on some computers and to some people! Due to [slack space](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/slack-space.htm) small files such as 6 byte .ignore files actually take up 4 KB of HDD space each.**

If you have a previous release of **choco-cleaner** installed, upgrading to a new version will NOT modify your current scheduled task or time.
