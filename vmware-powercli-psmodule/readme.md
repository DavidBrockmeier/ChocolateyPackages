**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package will always install the specific version from the Microsoft PowerShell Gallery as long as it exists there. 
* This package installs using the PowerShell Gallery. PowerShell Gallery requires PowerShell 5.0+ which is set as a dependency. If PowerShell 5.0+ is not already installed, it requires a reboot to become functional and this package will fail to install. If this happens to you because PowerShell 5.0+ was installed with this package, reboot and try again.
* Uninstall may fail if you've used any of the modules within the current PowerShell. If you are uninstalling from CMD.EXE - have no fear.
