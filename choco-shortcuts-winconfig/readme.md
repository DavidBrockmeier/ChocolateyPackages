**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* Yes, I considered icons for more advanced functions such as to view and change Chocolatey Features, Sources, and apikey. BUT (notice that's a big but) those are advanced commands that I feel the average user wouldn't need. The people who know what those things do are more likely to just go to the Command Prompt and do it anyway. A bigger reason why I didn't add this is that Windows 10 doesn't allow nested menus. So if I added another 3-9 shortcuts, it would be very cluttered. On Windows 7 the additional shortcuts could be managed nicely under a separate folder, I wish Windows 10 worked that way still..

ROADMAP:
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
