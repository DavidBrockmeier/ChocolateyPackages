OSFMount is a free utility designed for use with PassMark OSForensics™

##Overview

OSFMount allows you to mount local disk image files (bit-for-bit copies of a disk partition) in Windows with a drive letter. You can then analyze the disk image file with [PassMark OSForensics](https://www.osforensics.com/index.html)™ by using the mounted volume's drive letter. By default, the image files are mounted as read only so that the original image files are not altered.

OSFMount also supports the **creation of RAM disks**, basically a disk mounted into RAM. This generally has a large speed benefit over using a hard disk. As such this is useful with applications requiring high speed disk access, such a database applications, games (such as game cache files) and browsers (cache files). A second benefit is security, as the disk contents are not stored on a physical hard disk (but rather in RAM) and on system shutdown the disk contents are not persistent.

OSFMount supports **mounting images of CDs in .ISO format** , which can be useful when a particular CD is used often and the speed of access is important.

* It is recommended that 64-bit Windows is used when large disk image files are to be mounted. The 32-bit version can only be used on 32-bit Windows. The 64-bit version can only be used on 64-bit Windows. 
* Users must have administrator privileges.
* RAM: 1GB. When mounting large disk images, the more RAM the better.
