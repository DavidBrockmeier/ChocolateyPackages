**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package includes binaries. This release will work forever.
* This package will only install if IrfanView is installed in it's default directory.
* This package SHOULD work with 64bit installs, 32bit installs, and 32bit on 64bit Windows installs.
* I personally use and endorse this program.

ROADMAP
* I might update this in the future to include a package parameter for IrfanView's installation directory when not default.
