Cobian Backup is a multi-threaded program that can be used to schedule and backup your files and directories from their original location to other directories/drives in the same computer or other computer in your network. FTP backup is also supported in both directions (download and upload).

Cobian Backup exists in two different versions: application and service. The program uses very few resources and can be running on the background on your system, checking your backup schedule and executing your backups when necessary.

Cobian Backup is not an usual backup application: it only copies your files and folders in original or compressed mode to other destination, creating a security copy as a result. So Cobian Backup can be better described as a "Scheduler for security copies". Cobian Backup supports several methods of compression and strong encryption.
####PACKAGING NOTES: This is a pseudo-silent install. You will see window dialogue boxes pop up and subsequently go away. There is no silent uninstall, use the Control Panel. This program is (has to be) hardcoded to an install path of C:\Program Files\Cobian Backup 11. If your Windows System Drive is not C:, don't use this package.
