**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* GPU-Z is updated frequently. If installation fails due to a new version, please open an issue on GitHub and I will get to it ASAP. 
* Binary is included. This package will make an icon on your desktop. It does not actually "install." When you run GPU-Z it will give you the option to install or run stand-alone.
* I personally endorse this program.
