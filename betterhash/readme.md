**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This program is updated frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
* I found the concept and implementation of this program interesting. I tried it and BetterHash estimated $7USD/month revenue on an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU @3.40GHz with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 745. I like it but don't personally use it at the moment.
