**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
* An extra note about Google programs: Google updates the installer frequently even without changing the program version. When this happens the install will fail based on checksums. I recommend installing with --ignore-checksums if you have a problem. I really don't want to re-release this program 3 or 4 times because the installer changed but the program didn't. PLEASE check the program version after install and I would happy to release a new package when the actual program gets upgraded and not just the installer. If you find a newer version open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be upgraded.
