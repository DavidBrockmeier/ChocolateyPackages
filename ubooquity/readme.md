**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the .ZIP file via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* If Ubooquity is running, upgrades will fail. You must manually quit it and upgrde. I don't know how to script stopping a specific Java program without stopping all running Java programs. If you know how, feel free to tell me!
* I personally use and endorse this program.
