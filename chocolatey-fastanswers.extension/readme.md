**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original!
* I personally (will) use and endorse this extension.

ROADMAP:
* Add more functions in my head such as Get-IsGEWin8 (Or Get-IsMin8?) for quick checking minimums. 
* Am open to any useful suggestions/additions!
* Do timing tests on WMI versus other methods for optimization.
