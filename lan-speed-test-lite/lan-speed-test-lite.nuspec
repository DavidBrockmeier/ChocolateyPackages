LAN Speed Test (Lite) is a FREE utility designed from the ground up to be a simple but powerful tool for measuring file transfer, hard drive, USB Drive, and Local Area Network (LAN) speeds (wired and wireless). It does this by building a file in memory, then transfers it both ways (without effects of windows file caching) while keeping track of the time, and then does the calculations for you. Simple concept and easy to use. You’ll find that LAN Speed Test will quickly become one of your favorite network tools!

Some of LAN Speed Test features include…

Completely portable – No installation needed
Compatible With all Windows versions 2000 and up (2000, XP, Vista, Win7, Server2003 and Server 2008)
New! Now available for Mac users and soon Linux users
Incredibly small (120KB Windows, 370KB Mac) and can run from a hard drive, USB Flash drives, etc.

Simple concept and easy to use

Can be used with LST Server for a more accurate ‘True’ network speed without hard drive limitations – Even test WAN (internet) speed with LST Server
And much more!
PACKAGE NOTES: Will most likely upgrade throughout the v1.3.x life as the author's website displays v1.3.1 as the latest version but this is v1.3.2 at time of packaging. Stand-alone package, no install.
