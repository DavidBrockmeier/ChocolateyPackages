**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* This installs no software. It modifies Windows registry keys controlling the settings for your taskbar.
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!
* The Windows Store icon may not come back even if you set it to yes. 

ROADMAP:
* Test if this can be used with Computer\HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

CHANGELOG:
* 0.0.3 added USEPOWERSHELL option for Win10 Redstone 2/CU/b1703+
* 0.0.2 added -ea SilentlyContinue so Win8 and Win10 specific features do not fail the script when trying to change settings on incompatible versions of Windows
* 0.0.1 initial release
