**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* This installs no software. It modifies Windows registry keys controlling the settings for your taskbar.
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!

ROADMAP:
* Test if this can be used with Computer\HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
