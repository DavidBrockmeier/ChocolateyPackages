**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* You will need an account at http://www.neat.com/ to use this software. 
* Uninstall is not silent. Chocolatey will start the uninstaller, but you will be prompted.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
