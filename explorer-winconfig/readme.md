**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* This installs no software. It modifies Windows registry keys controlling the settings for Windows Explorer.
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!

ROADMAP:
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please. There are many other options I could add.

CHANGELOG:
* 0.0.1 initial release
