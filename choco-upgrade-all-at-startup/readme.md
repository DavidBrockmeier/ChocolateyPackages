**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! (Inspired by https://daniel.streefkerkonline.com/2016/02/23/create-a-scheduled-task-to-keep-all-chocolatey-packages-up-to-date/)
* This may NOT work on Windows 7 / Windows Server 2012. I've added PowerShell v4 as a dependency in hopes it will work.
* I previously used this package but now use [choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at).

CHANGELOG:
2018.01.30 - simplified, standardized, description updated, uninstall added
2017.01.10 - original release
