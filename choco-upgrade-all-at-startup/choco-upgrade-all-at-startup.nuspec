#DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY TIME YOUR COMPUTER BOOTS? 

#YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!
	
###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "choco upgrade all -y" every time your computer boots.

**WARNING:** Your computer boot time will increase! If you reboot daily, you'll never notice. If you reboot infrequently, you'll notice a slow down as packages are updated, especially if you have a slow Internet connection. Because of this **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** is pseudo-deprecated and pseudo-superseded by [choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at) which allows you to set a time to run "choco upgrade all -y" every day in the wee hours of morning while you're happily dreaming about supercomputers and not waiting for your computer to boot up.
