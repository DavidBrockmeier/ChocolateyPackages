##Create a Scheduled Task to keep all Chocolatey Packages up-to-date

FEBRUARY 23, 2016 / DANIEL S

Rebuilding your PC is always a drag, even with useful utilities like Ninite.

I recently created a PowerShell DSC script that I can use whenever I need to rebuild my PC. As part of that, I used the cChoco provider to automatically install applications using Chocolatey. I’ll be writing a blog post with more details shortly.

That’s a great way to get the applications installed, but not for keeping them up-to-date. Chocolatey allows you to run ‘choco upgrade all’ manually to do this:

Rather than manually create the scheduled task to automate this, I created this short PowerShell script:

$chocoCmd = Get-Command -Name 'choco' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -WarningAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
if ($chocoCmd -eq $null) { break }
$taskAction = New-ScheduledTaskAction –Execute $chocoCmd -Argument 'upgrade all -y'
$taskTrigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
$taskUserPrincipal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId 'SYSTEM'
$taskSettings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -Compatibility Win8
$task = New-ScheduledTask -Action $taskAction -Principal $taskUserPrincipal -Trigger $taskTrigger -Settings $taskSettings
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Run a Choco Upgrade All at Startup' -InputObject $task -Force

The script will:

* Locate the choco.exe binary (It’ll quit if it can’t find it in the path)
* Set up a scheduled task that runs said binary at system startup

Note that this script will only work on Windows 8 and newer machines, because it relies on the *-ScheduledTask cmdlets.
