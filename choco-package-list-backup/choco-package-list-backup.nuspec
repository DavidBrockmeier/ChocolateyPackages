###choco-package-list-backup.ps1 solves your personal Chocolatey migration and package re-installation problems!

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** is a script I wrote that will backup the list of your currently installed Chocolatey packages and save them to a packages.config file. You can then use that packages.config file to re-install all your packages on another computer or even the same computer later if it crashes. "How can I re-install on the same computer if it crashed and I lost the packages.config file?" Thanks for asking! **choco-package-list-backup.ps1** saves locally and to multiple cloud services!

####Features:

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** supports saving packages.config to all of the following:

* your local Documents folder
* your Active Directory assigned HOMESHARE
* Dropbox
* Google Drive
* Microsoft OneDrive
* NETGEAR ReadyCLOUD
* Resilio Sync
* TonidoSync
* more coming (let me know what you want/need)

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** saves in computer (name) specific folders so you can backup your Chocolatey package list from multiple computers to the same cloud destination(s).

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** is configurable. You can:

* configure which locations you want or don't want to save to (default=all the locations found)
* configure to save package version information or not (default=False)
* configure what subfolder to save to (default=ChocolateyPackageListBackup)
* easily add custom locations with no or little scripting experience - just copy, paste, and edit 3 variables

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** is saved to the Chocolatey's bin folder (\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin), so it's in your path.

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** supports copying [InstChoco](https://chocolatey.org/packages/instchoco) with the packages.config path for the fastest way ever to reinstall Chocolatey and migrate your packages! 

**choco-package-list-backup.ps1** instructions:

* Edit \ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco-package-list-backup.ps1 to customize your backup(s). (see comments in file)
* From PowerShell, type CHOCO-PACKAGE-LIST-BACKUP.PS1 to backup your Chocolatey packages list.
* From Command Prompt, type POWERSHELL CHOCO-PACKAGE-LIST-BACKUP.PS1 to backup your Chocolatey packages list.

**Use choco-package-list-backup along with [ForcePS](https://chocolatey.org/packages/forceps) for easy execution and [InstChoco](https://chocolatey.org/packages/instchoco) for a complete backup and recovery solution of your Chocolatey packages.**
