**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* If you have problems running this due to your Windows PowerShell Script Execution Policy, [ForcePS](https://chocolatey.org/packages/forceps) can make your life easier - but now you can just run from the Start menu or the batch file!

ROADMAP:
* Add other cloud services support by request
* Create a scheduled task to run daily/weekly/monthly/whenever
* Move configuration data to a seperate file
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
