**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* If you need to change your PowerShell Execution Policy, read [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about_Execution_Policies?view=powershell-5.1) or type "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser" into PowerShell.



ROADMAP:
* Put the checking of save locations in a loop
* Add other cloud services support by request
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository
* Create a scheduled task to run daily/weekly/monthly/whenever
* digitally sign the script
* Possibly compile to a proper executable program
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
