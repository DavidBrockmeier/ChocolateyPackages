**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)

Currently can backup to Documents folder, Dropbox, Google Drive, HomeShare (domain joined computers), OneDrive, NETGEAR ReadyCLOUD, Resilio Sync, and TonidoSync.

ROADMAP:
* Put the checking of save locations in a loop
* Add other cloud services support by request
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository
* Create a scheduled task to run daily/weekly/monthly/whatever
* Possibly compile to a proper executable program
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
