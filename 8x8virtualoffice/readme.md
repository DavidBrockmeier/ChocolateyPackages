**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the .MSI file via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* I used to use 8x8 hosted VOIP for two businesses. I have clients that use it and are 100% happy. It's a great VOIP phone service. I switched to cell phones only because I got an offer that I couldn't refuse. If you read this and choose to use 8x8 - mention me, Bill Curran, and I get a referral kickback from them. :) TIA!
