**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* If you run the program and a command prompt window just flashes by, change/update/fix your JAVA_HOME environment variable.
