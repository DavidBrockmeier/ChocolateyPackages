**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* This is a ~4 GB file. It may take about 10 minutes to download and a few more to install! Make sure you have ~12 GB free space to cover the .ZIP download, the extraction, and the install.
