**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* Plex Media Player supports 64 bit Windows only, there is no 32 bit client available.
* Silent uninstall doesn't work ("C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\{28b124d2-8272-45c9-b15b-83ed95c69f6e}\PlexMediaPlayer-2.1.0.74-8e24a8f4-windows-x64.exe" /uninstall /quiet). Uninstall manually via Control Panel
