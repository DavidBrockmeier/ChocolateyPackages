nuBASIC has been designed by the author, Antonino Calderone, mainly for educational purposes both for C++ developers that can deal with a non-trivial example of C++11 programming and for beginners, which may get hooked on programming. 
It is suitable for simple games, educational or small business programs.

Anyone who has previously worked with other BASIC languages will quickly become accustomed to nuBASIC.
Large sections of the basic constructs of nuBASIC are compatible with other BASIC dialects.

nuBASIC is also very simple. It is an excellent tool for teaching programming to a complete beginner, despite this, it has all the features of a modern programming language.

It allows you to write both classic BASIC programs (which use line numbers and GoTo or GoSub control structures) and procedure oriented programs, based on procedural programming paradigm.

Features
