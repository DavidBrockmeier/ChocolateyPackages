Q-Dir (the Quad Explorer) makes your files and folders easy to manage, either installed or as a portable Windows program. 

Fast and easy access to your hard disks, network folders, USB-sticks, floppy disks and other storage devices. 

Q-Dir is a great alternative file manager for Windows with a amazing Quadro-View technique. 

You don't have to give up your usual work habits, drag 'n' drop, view types, and other standard functions of your current file manager. 

No! Q-Dir gives you extra useful functions to make you happy. Save time by reducing mouse-clicks and hand movements . Q-Dir does not have to be installed and can be executed easily from any location, such as the Desktop, and can be carried on a small USB-stick or other memory device. 

Q-Dir's file management is based on MS Windows Explorer, but 4x plus Explorer View Tabs and with more functionality! More and more data makes for a larger file management challenge on you Windows OS. 
 
Q-Dir allows you to save folder combinations as a favourite to open any time. Up to 64 folder combinations can be saved in a favorite, since each of the four windows is equipped with tabs  (ie 4 x 16 tabs 4 x Tree View plus 4 x Address Bar).
