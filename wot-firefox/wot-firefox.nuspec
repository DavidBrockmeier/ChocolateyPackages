###WOT OVERVIEW
Web of Trust (aka WOT) is a known worldwide website reputation and rating service that helps you make informed decisions about whether to trust a website or not when you are searching, shopping or surfing online. WOT increases your personal online security and web safety. Web Of Trust is based on the Crowdsourcing Approach. Millions of users rate websites throughout the Internet and share their personal experience. This helps you avoid online threats that only real life experience can detect, such as scams, untrustworthy links, rogue web stores, etc.

###HOW WEB OF TRUST WORKS
The WOT add-on shows website reputations as traffic lights next to search results when you use Google, Yahoo!, Bing or any other search engine: green for good, red for bad, and yellow as a warning to be cautious. These icons are also visible next to links in social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter; Email services like Gmail and Yahoo!Mail; as well as popular websites like Wikipedia.
By clicking the traffic light icon you can find details about a website’s reputation, safety information and users’ opinions. A green traffic light means users have rated the site as trusted and reliable, red warns about danger or potential online threats and yellow indicates that you need to be cautious when using a site.

###WEB OF TRUST ADVANTAGES
WOT ratings and reviews are powered by a global community of millions of users who rate websites based on their personal experiences. In addition, trusted third-party sources are used to warn you about malicious software and other online threats that you might encounter.
You can share your experiences too by rating websites and help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.
Web Of Trust (WOT) has been featured in the New York Times, CNET, PC World, Kim Komando show, Tech Republic, PC Welt and many other popular media.
