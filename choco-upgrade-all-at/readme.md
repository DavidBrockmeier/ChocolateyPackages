**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original!
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!
* I personally use and endorse this script/package/program/task/whatever-you-want-to-call-it.

CHANGELOG:
* 0.0.4.1 - Removed PowerShell dependency. Fixed compatibility with Windows 7 & 8 machines by using SchTasks.exe for everything and not using the Windows 10/Server 2016 only get-scheduledtask cmdlet.
* 0.0.4 - added option to run weekly.
