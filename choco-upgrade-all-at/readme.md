**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original!
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!
* I personally use and endorse this script/package/program/task/whatever-you-want-to-call-it.

ROADMAP:
* Add options for weekly and monthly instead of only daily.
* Cancel task to stop after xxx minutes in event of a non-silent package getting "stuck"
* Possibly drop the leading 0 required for times less than < 10:00 AM
