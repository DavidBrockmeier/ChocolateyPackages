# DESCRIPTION AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS PACKAGE ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND STILL BEING WORKED ON	
	
**Package Dependency on Windows 10** is a Chocolatey package for use as a dependency by package maintainers/creators. It is similar in concept to **[Chocolatey Fast Answers Extension](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-fastanswers.extension)** to provide a (proposed) standard way for dealing with packages/programs that are OS version specific. This package will purposely fail (throw) when Windows 10 is not found or an equal to or greater than version you specified.

###EXAMPLES FOR MAINTAINERS/PACKAGERS:

![Examples](https://cdn.rawgit.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/master/dependency-windows10/dependency-windows10_examples.png)

Look at [Version History](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dependency-windows10#versionhistory) for the builds you can specify.

#I NEED TO THINK THIS THROUGH MORE

###SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

Using **dependency-windows10** as a dependency to show Windows 10 as a package requirement and head off installation failures for your package is great idea since OS dependencies aren't currently a possibility via Chocolatey NuGet. When using **dependency-windows10** there is one special caveat that you should build into your chocolateyInstall.ps1 script:

Remove-Item $env:ChocolateyInstall\lib\dependency-windows10 -Recurse -ea SilentlyContinue

If you don't do this, you could destroy the possibility of using **dependency-windows10** by other package maintainers/creators. Why? Because if you use **dependency-windows10** v10.0 (allowing any version of Windows 10) for your package, it's natural at some point a user will do a "cup all" and **dependency-windows10** will be updated to v10.1809.

***

###NOTE TO CHOCOLATEY MODERATORS:

Seeing **dependency-windows10** listed as dependency on any package indicates the package has a requirement of Windows 10. The package will fail automated testing because of this and require an exception from moderation.
