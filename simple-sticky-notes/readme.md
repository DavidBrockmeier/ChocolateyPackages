**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the proram released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* Uninstalling will open up a "Thank you for downloading Simple Sticky Notes" on the developer's webpage.
* I use and endorse this program. I miss the old 3M Post-It Notes program (not updated since 2005?), I'm finding this to be my favorite replacement.
