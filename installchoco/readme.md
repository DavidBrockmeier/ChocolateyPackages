**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* v1.00 soon as I can get rid of the UAC when not running as admin
* Three second delay after running InstallChoco is purposeful. InstallChoco is checking network connectivity. (I'm trying to decide whether or not to remove this.)


ROADMAP:
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository (Low priority unless someone asks.)
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

Like my [packages](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/bcurran3)?
