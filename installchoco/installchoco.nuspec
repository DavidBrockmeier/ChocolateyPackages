##QUESTION: "Why do I need an installer for Chocolatey when I've already got Chocolatey installed?"

##ANSWER: You need it for the NEXT time you want to install Chocolatey and it will make the task EASIER!

I wrote this as a batch file a couple of years ago so I wouldn't constantly have to reference Chocolatey.org for the VERY long command to install Chocolatey. I put in some basic error checking for administrator privileges, network connectivity, date checking, etc. I then placed the batchfile on my local server, on my website, in Dropbox, on USB thumbdrives, everywhere I could think of so I'd have easy access to it. I've used it for my computers, friend's computers, client's computers, and almost every Wintel computer I've touched in the last few years. It has served me well and sved me time. I've now stripped out all the annoying pauses, made it no interaction required, and compiled it to an executable program called **InstallChoco**. It's now much more suitable for other people to take advantage of as well. The EUREKA! moment in re-creating this as an executable was after writing my [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup) script. I realized I could go a step further by integrating [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup) along with **InstallChoco** for a complete backup and recovery solution of my/your/his/her/their/everyone's Chocolatey packages. I hope **InstallChoco** serves you well.

Features:

* **InstallChoco** uses Rob's ["Install with cmd.exe"](https://chocolatey.org/install) method for installing Chocolatey.
* **InstallChoco** integrates with [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup) to provide a very convienant way to reinstall Chocolatey and your backed up packages list.
* **InstallChoco** will enable up to three choco features if you pass them as parameters, i.e. allowGlobalConfirmation, failOnAutoUninstaller, allowEmptyChecksums, etc.
* **InstallChoco** will automatically run CINST PACKAGES.CONFIG -Y if packages.config is found in the current directory.

You can find **InstallChoco.exe** in \programdata\chocolatey\lib\installchoco\tools. I tell you this because I KNOW you want to copy it to your local server, website, Dropbox, USB thumbdrives, and everywhere you can think of so you'll have easy access to it.

Usage: InstallChoco -y
