    <summary>Chocolatey Misc Helpers Extension is a collection of helper functions for package creators/maintainers.</summary>
    <description>
##**chocolatey-misc-helpers.extension** provides helper functions to be used in Chocolatey install/uninstall scripts by package creators/maintainers. 

These didn't fit into the concept scope of my other extensions so I started this miscellaneous collection and will add to it as "needed."

###HELPERS:
* **Start-CheckandStop** - Checks for and stops a process if running. Creates variables to easily restart the process after a package upgrade. Useful for installers that fail if the program is running, i.e. KeePass, uTorrent, etc. or for stopping programs that automatically run after install, i.e. Skype, SuMo, Ellp, etc. as well as for programs that will stop running during an upgrade and then not return to a running state post upgrade, i.e. Plex Media Server, etc.
* **Start-WaitandStop** - starts a background process to stop a (foreground) process - quits after 5 minutes or after the process gets stopped. Useful to stop additional pop-up programs during installation. 
* **Start-WaitandStopActual** - (do not directly use) called by Start-WaitandStop to make Start-WaitandStop simple to use.
* **Test-Dependency** - Provides a way to verify a dependency is installed. Does NOT check version. Returns True/False. i.e. **Test-Dependency** "[dependency-windows10](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dependency-windows10)"
* **Read comments in the scripts for help implementing.**

###USAGE:
* Start-CheckandStop "ProcessName"
* Start-WaitandStop "ProcessName"
* Test-Dependency "DependencyName"

The functions below were added to v0.0.2 but were later nullified; included for backward compatibility with pre-release versions in the wild. Any questions, look at the comments in the files.
