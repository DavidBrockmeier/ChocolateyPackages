#InstChoco - The ultimate Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer!
	
##QUESTION: "Why do I need an installer for Chocolatey when I already have Chocolatey installed?"

##ANSWER: You need InstChoco for the NEXT time you want to install Chocolatey and automate package (re)installation!

**InstChoco** is the evolution of an old batch file I used to automate installing Chocolatey and a standardized list of commonly used packages. I use it on every Wintel computer I touch. Besides just easily installing Chocolatey, it is extremely useful in automated standard setups. SysAdmins will love the new features added to **InstChoco** v1.20+. You can find **InstChoco.exe** in \ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\instchoco\tools.

###Standard Features:

* **InstChoco** uses ferventcoder/Rob's ["Install with cmd.exe"](https://chocolatey.org/install) method for installing Chocolatey.
* **InstChoco** will enable up to four choco features if you pass them as parameters, i.e. allowGlobalConfirmation, failOnAutoUninstaller, allowEmptyChecksums, useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades, etc.
* **InstChoco** can download a packages.config file from the Internet and install packages from that downloaded file! (NEW!)
* **InstChoco** will automatically search for a PACKAGES.CONFIG file in various locations and install packages from it if found. 
* **InstChoco** has baked in support for [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup). **InstChoco** will use the first found PACKAGES.CONFIG in the following order: current directory, Documents folder, HOMESHARE, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, ReadyCLOUD, Nextcloud, Resilio Sync, Seafile, or Tonido Sync.
* **InstChoco** has baked in support for [Choco Persistent Packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages). **InstChoco** will use PERSISTANTPACKAGES.CONFIG and install packages from it if found - always.
* **InstChoco** has baked in support for Windows Active Directory domains. **InstChoco** will use various PACKAGES.CONFIG files based on domain and user account to install packages from them if found - always. Now you can standardize your organization with base Chocolatey package installs!

###Special Features for Windows Active Directory Domains:

* **InstChoco** will use domainnamePACKAGES.CONFIG and install packages from it if found - always. This allows Windows domain joined computers to have installed a common base setup of Chocolatey packages across all organizational computers. To use this feature, system administrators of Windows domains need to create a domainnamePACKAGES.CONFIG file and put it in your logon server's NETLOGON directory; i.e. \\Contoso\NETLOGON\ContosoPACKAGES.CONFIG
* **InstChoco** will use usernamePACKAGES.CONFIG and install packages from it if found - always. This allows users of Windows domain joined computers to have their own specific Chocolatey packages installed for them (useful for roaming users). To use this feature, system administrators or users of Windows domains need to create a usernamePACKAGES.CONFIG file and put it in the root of the user's HOMESHARE; i.e. \\Contoso\UserName$\UserNamePACKAGES.CONFIG
