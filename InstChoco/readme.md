**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* Three second delay after running **InstChoco** is purposeful. **InstChoco** is checking network connectivity.


ROADMAP:
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository (Low priority unless someone asks.)
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

Like my [packages](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/bcurran3)? 

Find them useful?
