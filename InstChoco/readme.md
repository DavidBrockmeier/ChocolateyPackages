**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* Five second delay after running **InstChoco** is purposeful.

ROADMAP:
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository (Low priority unless someone asks.)
* Add default domain packages install support.
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

v1.10 CHANGE LOG:
* Added [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup) and [choco persistent packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages) support for package (re)installation.
* changed lots of the cosmetics
* checks for year 2018 or greater instead of 2017 or greater
* updated donation info :)
