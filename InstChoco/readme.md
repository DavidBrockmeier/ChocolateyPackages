**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* Five second delay after running **InstChoco** is purposeful.
* It is not recommended to run InstChoco without the -ynp switch on servers if you are using the Windows Active Directory Domain features!

ROADMAP:
* Possibly add domain security group specific package support; i.e. MARKETING needs GIMP but DEVELOPMENT doesn't. DEVELOPMENT needs NOTEPAD++ but MARKETING doesn't.
* Possibly add server specific support; i.e. Servers don't need all the packages that your workstations get from the packages in your domain package list. 
* Add ability to use a different source other than the Chocolatey public repository (Low priority unless someone asks.)
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.

v1.20 CHANGE LOG:
* Added domain support to install predefined packages for domain joined computers and user specific packages.

v1.11 CHANGE LOG: (unreleased)
* Added -ynp switch to skip installation of packages (Install Chocolatey only)

v1.10 CHANGE LOG:
* Added [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup) and [choco persistent packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages) support for package (re)installation.
* changed lots of the cosmetics
* checks for year 2018 or greater instead of 2017 or greater
* updated donation info :)
