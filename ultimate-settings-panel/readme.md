**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* Install and un-install will open your default browser to a Thank you and Sorry to see you leave page respectively.
* I personally use and endorse this.
