###Use PDQ Deploy to install applications and patches to all the computers in your company. Pro and Enterprise mode customers have access to pre-made packages ready to deploy. NOTE: Trial users have access to up to three applications to deploy. Full access to the library is not provided during your trial.

* Integrates with Active Directory, Spiceworks, PDQ Inventory, and more
* Installs to multiple computers simultaneously
* Shows real-time status
* Installs just about anything
* Agentless	

###Install MSIs to Multiple Computers
Need to install an MSI? Just create a new PDQ Package and point it to the MSI. If the installation has more than a single MSI file, be sure to check the “Include Entire Directory” checkbox.

###Install EXEs to Multiple Computers
Need to install an EXE? All you need to do is verify that the application can be installed silently. (By default MSIs have this ability, but EXEs need to be explicitly told to run silently.) Not every EXE supports this feature, but most do.

The challenge will be to determine the correct method to run it silently. The silent parameter (sometimes called a switch) can be /s or /S, /q or /Q, /quiet, /qn, and a host of other options. Sometimes the installations are case sensitive, so be sure to use exactly what the vendor states is the correct switch.

###Ready-to-Deploy Installs in the Package Library
We created the Package Library so that our users wouldn’t have to spend time with every Java or Flash update that comes down the pike. When you are a Pro or Enterprise mode customer you get access to the Package Library you can get common apps that are already in PDQ Packages, and are ready for deploying to all your computers. See the full list of ready-to-go silent installs.

###OS Requirements
Windows Vista, 7, 8x, 10, Server (2008x, 2012x, 2016x)
