**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* This is a stand-alone executable downloaded from Microsoft. When you run it, and after accepting the license, it will extract files and start attempting to fix problems. This package will make an icon on your desktop and Start Menu. It does not actually "install."
* The program has been released multiple times with the same version number.
