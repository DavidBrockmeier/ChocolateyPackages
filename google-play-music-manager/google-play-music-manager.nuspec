Google Play helps you bring your iTunes library to your Android devices. You can upload up to 50,000 of your songs from your computer to Google Play for free. Once you’ve uploaded your music, it's instantly available on the web and your Android phone or tablet. No wires, downloading or syncing.

##Sign up for your Google Play music library

##Upload your collection
Sign in to Music Manager, choose where you keep your music and it starts uploading automatically. And when you add new music to your computer, Music Manager can automatically add it to your library too. You can upload 50,000 of your songs for free. Music Manager even adds your iTunes playlists and ratings so you can start listening to your favorites right away.

##Access your music on the web and your Android phone
Now that you've set up your Google Play music library, you can access it on your Android phone or tablet and the web. Sign in and all your music is just there, like magic.
