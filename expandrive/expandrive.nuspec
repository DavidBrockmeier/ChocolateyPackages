##ExpanDrive 6 is up to 500% faster and has a robust offline-sync mode. It adds BackBlaze B2, Google Team Drives, SMB/CIFS and an entirely new User interface with context menus, transfer badges, search, file versioning, link-sharing and so much more.

###Supports every Cloud
ExpanDrive creates a virtual drive for Mac and Windows that connects to all major cloud storage providers such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Team Drive, Amazon Drive, Box, OneDrive, Openstack Swift, BackBlaze B2, Amazon S3 or your own SFTP, FTP or WebDAV server and SMB/Windows File Sharing.

###Super-fast uploads with Strongsync
ExpanDrive 6 changes the game again with a new multi-threaded connection engine that is up to 500% faster. ExpanDrive moves transfers into the background and transfers your files in parallel. This lets you keep working and stop waiting for transfers to complete. ExpanDrive v6 quickly uploads your files in the background.

###Cloud storage in every application
ExpanDrive 6 acts just like a USB drive plugged into your computer. Open, edit, and save files to remote computers from within your favorite programs—even when they are on a server half a world away. Enhance every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.

###Finder and Explorer is your user interface
Securely access any remote file server directly from Finder and Explorer, or even the terminal. There’s no need to open a separate transfer client just for file transfer. ExpanDrive 6 extends the way all applications can access data.

####System Requirements:
* Windows XP SP3 or newer, tested through Windows 8.1
* Supports 32-bit and 64-bit installations
* Supports Windows Server editions, including terminal server
* Does not support Windows RT

####ExpanDrive runs unlicensed and fully featured for 7 days giving you a chance to try everything out. Once the trial period you’ll need to buy a license or you will be limited to 20 minutes of use.
####Single User license is $49.95.
