####What is DriverMax ?

DriverMax is a tool that changes the way you update your computer drivers. Remember how hard it was to search by yourself all the drivers you needed? DriverMax changed that. You no longer have to do this by yourself, DriverMax has got you covered. It scans your computer and identifies missing or outdated/faulty drivers, downloads them and installs them for you.

##Who is it for?

####Typical computer users

Having trouble with you USB stick or maybe your webcam isn't working? Are your speakers causing you problems? These issues are usually caused by malfunctioning drivers (the programs that control the operation of devices). DriverMax can fix these problems for you in just a matter of a few clicks.

####Skilled computer users

Did your computer freeze or slow down, or maybe it's crashing frequently? You might want to update or fix your faulty drivers. You won't be surprised to see how much faster your PC will perform with the help of DriverMax. With DriverMax, you are all set in just a few easy steps.

####Computer technicians

Pinpointing malfunctioning or missing drivers takes a lot of time for a single computer, let alone multiple PCs. DriverMax allows you to download drivers on one PC and then move them to other computers. With DriverMax you can also create backups for drivers even when formatting a computer.

##Why update my system drivers ?

Most of the situations when Windows is running slower are caused by faulty driver installations. Updating your system drivers makes your PC run better by preventing device errors. DriverMax provides you with quicker repairs and with the possibility of removing or updating obsolete driver versions. By doing so, DriverMax helps you ward off conflicts and enhance computer strength.

Because of the fact that Windows stores all versions of older drivers, older versions get mixed up with more recent ones. To avoid that, the DriverMax Export Wizard will only export the drivers you select by copying the needed files to a folder or a compressed ZIP file. DriverMax allows you to export all your current drivers (or just the ones that work ok) to a folder or a compressed file. After reinstalling Windows you will have everything in one place!

DriverMax finds and downloads the best drivers for your PC for:

* Windows 10
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8
* Windows 7
* Windows Vista
* Windows XP
* Both 64-bit and 32-bit editions of Windows are fully supported.

### PACKAGING NOTES: 
* DriverMax is updated VERY frequently. This package will likely fail, based on checksums, within a few days. It is recommended you install with the "--ignore-checksum" option (choco install drivermax --ignore-checksum) to ignore the checksums so the latest version of DriverMax will install even if this package is out of date.
* The uninstall is 99% silent. When DriverMax uninstalls it will open your default browser and give you an opportunity to buy the PRO version at a reduced rate. There seems to be no way around it. 
* Please post a DISQUS comment or on GitHub if you find this package out of date and I will upload a new package with the new checksum.
