**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This program is updated frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
* Once installed, DriverMax will prompt you for upgrades.
* Uninstall is 99% silent. When DriverMax uninstalls it will open your default browser and give you an opportunity to buy the PRO version at a reduced rate. There seems to be no way around it.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
