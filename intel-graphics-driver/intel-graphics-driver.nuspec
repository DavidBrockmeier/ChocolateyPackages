###About Intel® Software and Drivers

WARNING: Failure to follow the guidance below may result in system instability

These new drivers labeled as Windows DCH graphics drivers aren't backward compatible with our previous graphics drivers that we are now labeling Legacy. This means if later you want to revert to a Legacy driver you will need to uninstall the driver via Windows Apps and Features and reboot the system before installing a Legacy driver. Failure to do so may result in minor to major system instability.

DO NOT use the INF / Have-Disk method to install or uninstall this driver, as it bypasses the Intel installer designed to install these new drivers, thereby possibly resulting in minor to major system instability. For this reason, we're not providing the ZIP file for the next several driver releases while users transition to this new Microsoft* driver platform.
