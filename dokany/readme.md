**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* You will need to reboot your computer before dokany will install if kb2999226 gets installed as a dependency, or if you remove dokany and attempt to re-install.
* When new versions of dokany are released, please open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
