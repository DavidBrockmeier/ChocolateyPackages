**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* I had to take some liberties with this install. The MAK address for your TiVos has been entered as 1234567890, you will need to change it. The default to save/send video files is set to C:\TEMP, change it to what you want.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
