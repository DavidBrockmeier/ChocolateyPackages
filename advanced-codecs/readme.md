**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* Binary is included in the package. 
* Almost silent install: program will open up your default web browser to a setup and usage page. Sorry, I don't know how to get around this at the moment.
* Shark007's Advanced Codecs is updated by the author on average of twice a week. I tend to update this package once a week. If a newer version of Shark007's Advanced Codecs has been released, you might be prompted to download the newer version during installation. This currently isn't handled by the AutoHotKey script but I will add logic for it as soon as I have time.
* Uninstall is NOT silent.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
