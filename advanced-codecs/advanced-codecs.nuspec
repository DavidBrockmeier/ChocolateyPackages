##Shark007's FREE Codec solutions.

^^ over 15 million readers ^^
and over 16,000 registered forum members
The following quotations are from a person with vast multimedia experience.

"I'd suspect that if I put it to the test I'd find that K-Lite, for example, had done more damage (as measured by crash reports) than some notable percentage of actual outright malware."

"At one point 7 of the top 10 crashes in multimedia on Windows lead squarely to problems induced by K-Lite."

"...the fact remains that they (K-Lite) have been one of the most toxic projects ever released for Windows in any form."

The above quotations encapsulate what prompted me to produce my own codec packs.

Things the Shark pack does that other packs cannot do . . .

1. Full color thumbnails including FLV's and 10bit MKV's.
(also allows users to select at what point by percentage to grab the thumbnail)
2. Enable the Preview Pane for ALL newly enabled filetypes such as MKV and FLV.
3. Explorer properties are displayed for non native filetypes such as MKV and FLV
4. Updated often - and has update notification builtin

6. Support playback of MKV files on Extenders and on the Xbox One.
7. Support use of the LAV filters with the Play To function for MKV files.
8. Support playback of MOD audio files and M4A files containing ALAC
9. Supports playlist creation for use in Media Center
10. Allow users to Enable/Disable codecs installed on their system
11. Functionality such as Win7DSFilterTweaker builtin.
