**The following quotations are from a person with vast multimedia experience.**

"I'd suspect that if I put it to the test I'd find that K-Lite, for example, had done more damage (as measured by crash reports) than some notable percentage of actual outright malware."

"At one point 7 of the top 10 crashes in multimedia on Windows lead squarely to problems induced by K-Lite."

"...the fact remains that they (K-Lite) have been one of the most toxic projects ever released for Windows in any form."

**The above quotations encapsulate what prompted me to produce my own codec packs.**

K-Lite blatantly installs MALWARE. 
**According to the K-Lite author, if malware got installed, it is your own fault!!**
