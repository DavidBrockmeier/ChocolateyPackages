**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* This installs no software. It modifies Windows registry keys controlling the showing of your desktop icons.
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!
* This is probably the first of many -winconfig scripts. (I'm taking requests.)

ROADMAP:
* Test if this can be used with Computer\HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT
* Possibly add a RenameComputer:CustomText option.
* I'm open to suggestions - open a GitHub issue please.
