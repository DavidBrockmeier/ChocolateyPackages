**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original!
* I personally use and endorse this extension.
* The choco multi-instance checking is NOT compatible with the Chocolatey licensed self service agent as it runs choco.exe all the time.

CHANGE LOG:
* 0.0.1   - initial release

ROADMAP:
* Possibly add configurable options to enable disable each of the three checks.
* Probably add configurable timeouts for each of the three checks.
* Probably add conditional handling options for each of the three checks, i.e. option to abort install based on condition.
