#PRERELEASE - TESTING AND FEEDBACK IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED!
#KNOWN BUG - DOESN'T WORK WITH AUTO UNINSTALLER (YET!)
	
##**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is a Chocolatey extension that intercepts and runs checks before installing or uninstalling a program. This extension will start working automatically once installed and does NOT need to be implemented by package creators/maintainers. #**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is meant to be installed and thus used directly by Chocolatey end users.

###PURPOSE:
**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension**'s main purpose to fend off specific types of problems before they occur. Currently Chocolatey (choco.exe) is not multi-instance friendly. If you try to install packages using choco install or cinst in two Command Prompts at the same time, strange things may occur. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** avoids these strange things by intercepting calls to install programs and making choco.exe wait for previous instances to finish. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** also checks Windows Installer to see if it's busy and will make MSI installer programs wait until Windows Installer has finished processing the other program. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will pause and retry until [commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration) hits it's threshold of 2700 seconds/45 minutes (default) and then choco will abort. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** only runs before program installations. It does not perform any functions related to portable packages or other choco commands.

###FEATURES: 
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there is a pending reboot and warn you about it if so.
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there are instances of choco.exe already running and wait for them to finish.
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if Windows Installer is already running and wait for it to finish.
