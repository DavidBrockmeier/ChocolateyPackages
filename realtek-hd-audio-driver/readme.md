**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* This package checks to make sure you have Realtek drivers already installed and aborts if not. This should be used as an upgrade to your existing drivers. If you have Realtek hardware you should have some sort of old driver installed first for this to upgrade and work.
* If this fails with a script ERROR, your WMI might be corrupt. Try running Tweaking.com's Windows Repair using the Repair WMI script.
