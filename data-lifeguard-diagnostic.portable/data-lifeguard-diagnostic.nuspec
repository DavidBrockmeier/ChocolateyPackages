####Instructions

3. Read and accept the license agreement to continue.
4. On the main program screen, there are two windows. In the top window, you will see the drives in your system that are available for testing. The model number, serial number, capacity, and SMART status of each drive will be displayed. In the bottom window, the partition information for the selected drive will be displayed.
5. Highlight the drive and select the icon on the top row to test or run SMART status.
6. When you select the run tests icon, the "DLGDIAG - Select an Option" window appears.
7. You will see the following options:
* QUICK TEST - performs SMART drive quick self-test to gather and verify the Data Lifeguard information contained on the drive.
* EXTENDED TEST - performs a Full Media Scan to detect bad sectors. Test may take several hours to complete depending on the size of the drive.
* WRITE ZEROS - writes zeros to the drive with options of Full Erase and Quick Erase. File system and data will be lost.
* VIEW TEST RESULT - displays the latest test results.
8. Select the test you wish to perform and click the Start button.
9. When the test completes, you will be notified with a pass/fail message. Click the Close button.

####PACKAGING NOTE: If you want to install this program, you will find a setup program in the tools directory where this has been extracted. It does nothing more than copy the files to your Program Files directory and make the same icons. You will loose the ability to silenty uninstall the program.
