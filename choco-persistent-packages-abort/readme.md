**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original!
* This is a companion package for [choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at).
* The PowerShell cmdlet Get-ScheduledTask requires PowerShell v5. If your PowerShell gets upgraded to v5 as part of the dependencies, installation will fail and you'll have to attempt installation again. PowerShell v5 comes with Windows 10/Server 2016 by default.
* Read the INSTALL EXAMPLES again before use!
* I personally use and endorse this script/package/program/task/whatever-you-want-to-call-it.
