**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* DISCLAIMER: This package uses an AutoHotKey script to attempt automatic installation of the program. I have done my best to make this work for the majority, there are always a number of x-factors that can cause a 'hiccup.' Some events are timed and may timeout and thus fail on slower than expected systems. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you monitor the installation of this package to make sure it worked/installed correctly in your environment. There are situations such as upgrades and forced reinstalls that may not work and you will have to manually enter input to get the desired result. If you report an issue in GitHub and the program is in active development, I will try to enhance the AHK script and this package in the future.
* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* This program has been released multiple times with the same version number.
