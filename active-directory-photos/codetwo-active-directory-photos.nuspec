####Why would I need it to add photos to Active Directory?

You may need to add photographs to Active Directory to show them in internal Outlook messages, display in Outlook's contacts and Global Address List (GAL), or to add them to internal or outbound email. Letting people see each other's faces while corresponding adds more human touch to the communication. Sometimes it seems to be the only way for some people to know who is who in their own company. What is more, adding users' images to external messages makes your mail look more professional and also lets your customers see who they are corresponding with.
