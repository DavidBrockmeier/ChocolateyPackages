**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* DISCLAIMER: This package uses an AutoHotKey script to attempt automatic installation of the program. I have done my best to make this work for the majority, there are always a number of x-factors that can cause a 'hiccup.' Some events are timed and may timeout and thus fail on slower than expected systems. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you monitor the installation of this package to make sure it worked/installed correctly in your environment. There are situations such as upgrades and forced reinstalls that will probably not work and you will have to manually enter input to get the desired result. If you report an issue in GitHub and the program is in active development, I will try to enhance the AHK script and this package in the future.
* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* Installation of Grub2Win will default to C:, if your boot drive is not C:, don't use this package.
* Uninstall is not silent: Run Grub2Win and use the Uninstall button then run CHOCO UNINSTALL GRUB2WIN
* This package can not be re-installed, uninstall the program first (see above).
* It's ironic that I'm using AutoHotkey to manage the installation of a program that uses AutoIt to install.
* I started this package a year and a half ago, shelved it, and came back to it. Finally off the TDL!
