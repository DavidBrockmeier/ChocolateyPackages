***. Now Works With Any Language! ***
	
Grub2Win supports 64 and 32 bit EFI and BIOS on Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista and XP.

Safely dual boot Windows and Linux.

Grub2Win boots native, open source GNU grub version 2.02 code. Everything is contained in a single 14 MB directory on your Windows C: drive. On EFI systems a few small modules (about one half MB total) will be installed to your EFI partition.

Using the simple Windows GUI and instructions you can install Grub2Win quickly and safely. Boot time messages and help can be displayed in your native language.

Select from a nearly unlimited number of OS choices. Samples for Remix, Android, Ubuntu, Debian, Suse, Fedora, Mint, BSD and Windows are included.

You can enter your own custom commands for each menu entry.

Grub2Win started in 2010. It is now used in 180 countries worldwide and has been downloaded more than 300,000 times.
