    <summary>CMS is a remote viewing program for MAGIC Series DVRs.</summary>
    <description>
The Windows Central Management Software for MAGIC Series DVRs allows users to connect to and view security cameras from multiple DVR locations from a central client application. The software lets the user configure groups of connections, then picks and choose which cameras should be displayed.

NOTE: This has been tested with TVST (HD-TVI) and XVST (HD-SDI) MAGIC Series DVRs. It probably will work with UVST (EX-SDI) MAGIC Series DVRs as well.
